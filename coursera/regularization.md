## Regularization

If you suspect your **neural network** is **overfitting** your data. That is you have a **high variance** problem, one of the first things you should try per probably
1.  **Regularization**. 
2. The other way to address **high variance**, is to get **more training data** that's also quite reliable. 

But you can't always get more **training data**, or it could be **expensive to get more data**. But adding **regularization** will often help to prevent **overfitting**, or to reduce the errors in your network. So let's see how **regularization** works.
